<p>During the evening we get treated to a couple of presentations that show off what the latest version of Firefox is capable of with all the amazing updates and the neat user interface (UI) design also how and what of Mozilla Community in India. However, there is much more to Mozilla than Firefox.</p>

<p>First up is <a href="http://twitter.com/kaustavdm">Kaustav</a>, a Mozilla Rep. He gave us a great presentation about the latest changes/updates in Firefox. </p>

<p>It was a different kind of crowd unlike our normal Mozilla community events. People were interested in knowing more about the community and the different ways to get involved. It was really a fun evening.</p>
