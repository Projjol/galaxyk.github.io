<center><h1><a href=""><i class="fa fa-group"></i></a></h1></center>

<p>Every year <a href="http://fsmk.org">FSMK</a> organizes a 9 day summer camp in Bangalore. Students from different colleges all over Karnataka join the summer camp to learn, create, collaborate.</p>

<p>Last year's response for Maker Party at the Summer Camp was overwhelming and the organizers invited us to host Maker Party this year too! <a href=""><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></a></p>

<p><a href="https://party.webmaker.org/">Maker Party</a>, Mozillaâ€™s annual global campaign to teach the web, kicked off last week on July 15!<p>

<p>As always <a href="http://twitter.com/anknite">Ankit</a> started with what is Open Source, Open Web and why <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>! Explained briefly about all the Webmaker tools (X-ray Goggles, Thimble, Popcorn, Appmaker).</p>

<p>Then it was time to do some makes! Yay! The students were amazed to see how easy it is to see the HTML source code of a particular block with X-ray Goggles and at the same time replace the existing code to generate a new webpage.</p>

<p>We've given a <a href="http://bit.ly/fsmklinks">set of links</a> to start handson for those who want to remix something that is already available.</p>

<p>Webmaker tools are fun and challenging that made them understand the tools and how they can better learn and create something amazing on the Web.

<p>Most of the students were either <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors">Firefox Student Ambassadors</a> or wanted to know more about FSA. They were pretty excited to host their own Maker Parties at their colleges. Here's more for the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors/Activities/MakerParty">activities and resources</a> for FSA's.

<p>The Maker Party at FSMK Summer Camp was really fun, filled with smart and interesting people. Thanks to Vignesh, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/abhi12ravi">Abhiram</a> and all the volunteers who helped us with the event. As always, I am happy, excited and invigorated with the Maker Party! <a href=""><i class="fa fa-heart"></i></a>.</p>

<p>Some of the feedback we received from the participants:</p>

<p><i><span style="color: #cc0000;">"The softwares which u showed us today we really interesting and useful for us." <br>-- Mahesh</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="color: #cc0000;">"Appmaker must work on slow network connections. If it's in the form of software which can be installed in the pc it will be awesome!"<br>-- Akshay</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="color: #cc0000;">"Its a good experience to use such simple tools to design stuffs instead of programming it from scratch using just program codes :) I had lots of fun and it was a very good experience :) learning code is easy n helpful to learn to program it.. :) "<br>-- Mythreya</span></i></p>
