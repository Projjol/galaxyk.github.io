<div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yes! We can bypass the proxy server using <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>. Lots of colleges, schools, offices use proxy to block websites, the same situation is in my college too. I was trying out to bypass the proxy, did several experiments none of them worked, used lots of software's but of no use. </span><span style="font-size: small;">Today I just opened Google translate page to translate a technical stuff page from German to English and I just tried to translate an English page to English.. :P .. The first site which came into my mind is Youtube.. when I tried to do so then, voila! Youtube was opened on my browser. Then tried opening other blocked sites like rapidshare, megaupload and everything worked fine. :) </span></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: small;">This works because when you browse through it, then the IP address will be of Google and not you. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I don't know why people block websites, there are several websites and several codes to bypass the proxy! </div>
