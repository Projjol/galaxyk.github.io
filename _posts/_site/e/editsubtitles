<div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Editing subtitles in a Matroska file (MKV) is a very confusing task because the subtitles are embedded into it.&nbsp; Yesterday I searched some of the sites on how to edit those. None of the sites gave me an actual procedure. :( ..Anyways I figured it out!<br /><br />An MKV file has Audio, Video, Subtitle in it. Use MKV extraction to extract those files. <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for mkvextractgui and you'll get the file, and ya its <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> :) .&nbsp; Use the software to extract the files you want and then now its time to edit and merge, and mash up that file again. Edit the subtitle part, a normal notepad will do. Now join all those files again using the mkvmergegui software, Google it you will get and your new file is ready. :) ... <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is the only friend of mine who doesn't say I cant find!. That's it!, this is a very simple task not at all confusing, <b>"extract, edit, merge." </b><br /><br /><b>About<a href="http://www.matroska.org/"> Matroska</a> File<br /><br /></b>The <b>Matroska Multimedia Container</b> is an open  standard free container format, a file  format that can hold an unlimited number of video, audio, picture  or subtitle tracks inside a single file.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-0"></sup>  It is intended to serve as a universal format for storing common  multimedia content, like movies or TV shows. Matroska is similar in  concept to other containers like AVI, MP4 or ASF, but is entirely open in  specification, with implementations consisting mostly of open  source software. Matroska file types are .MKV for video (with  subtitles and audio), .MKA for audio-only files and .MKS for subtitles  only.</span></div>
