<p><h4>I feel awesome</h4></p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons I contribute to Open Source. One, is to give back something to the people from whose work I've benefitted greatly, to get to collaborate with smart and congenial people and, honestly, to build my resume! What I did not anticipate was that getting accepted into a community makes you feel so special. The <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> community was greatly supportive to me the entire way, with trainings, conferences, online meetings, work weeks when they could have done even without me. I truly felt that I was being accepted into a community <a href=""><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></a></p>

<p>The thought of having even the tiniest effect on a ubiquitous piece of software is thrilling. Your name on the beautiful <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2013/11/26/the-monument-to-mozillians-is-coming-to-san-francisco/">Firefox monument in San Francisco</a> and on the credits page. This thrill may be a narcissistic one, but I feel it's alright to revel in it. What's wrong with feeling satisfied that you've applied your skills to promote a product that millions of people use to browse the web?</p>

<p><h4>Beyond the code</h4></p>

<p>I spend most of my time at work writing code</p>

<p>The second day was filled with even more sessions, and some especially interesting quilt updates from all the teams:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>What are you most proud of in 2013?
<li>What was your biggest challenge in 2013?
<li>What is your big goal for 2014?
</li></li></li></ul></p>

<p>We enjoyed a delicious dinner, send-off for a few Mozillians and a corrupted video download by Deb at the hotel <a href=""><i class="fa fa-meh-o"></i></a> before calling it a night.</p>

<p>The Community India Meet-up was truly an amazing experience for me. I met so many people from the community for the first time. I am happy, excited and invigorated with the meet-up! Thanks everyone who could join us at the meet-up online & offline <a href=""><i class="fa fa-heart"></i></a>.</p>

<p>Contributing to open source is a great high; I canâ€™t wait for the coming years!</p>
